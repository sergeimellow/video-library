        / Everything above is super hacky and mostly temporary
        / 1) implement comments for each episode/ clip
        / 2) Impelemnt toggling view for all episodes/clips for each show with jquery
        / 3) Implement toggling of comment section view for each episode and hidden by default with jquery
        / 4) build public RESTful API for creating and reading content to the web app, write threshhold code so I don't 
        /    get trolled by some jokers by a bot that creates content in an infinite loop
        / 5) build CRONified twitter bot with whenever that tweets every time something new is created with my hueristics.
        /    Probably going to do it with after_save filter for episode model
        / 6) play around with dropping in a front-end framework into the app like reactjs / ember / angular since its going to be
        /    a SPA anyway.
